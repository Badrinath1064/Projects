|positive|,|@aussiecynic Watching you work is exhausing. Just thinking about it is making  me sleepy "|
|positive|,|the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries .|
|positive|,|offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .|
|positive|,|a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film .|
|positive|,|with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .|
|positive|,|a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass .|
|positive|,|not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare .|
|positive|,|scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism .|
|positive|,|occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective .|
|positive|,|spiderman rocks|
|positive|,|an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone .|
|positive|,|at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts .|
|positive|,|it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid .|
|positive|,|guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled .|
|positive|,|a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview .|
|positive|,|light , cute and forgettable .|
|positive|,|if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid .|
|positive|,|while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy .|
|positive|,|though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static .|
|positive|,|cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days|
|positive|,|ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn .|
|positive|,|though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them .|
|positive|,|like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series .|
|positive|,|newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg .|
|positive|,|the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .|
|positive|,|fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn .|
|positive|,|'compleja e intelectualmente retadora , el ladrón de orquídeas es uno de esos filmes que vale la pena ver precisamente por su originalidad . '|
|positive|,|the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound .|
|positive|,|karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat .|
|positive|,|gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film .|
|positive|,|a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know .|
|positive|,|tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable .|
|positive|,|may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .|
|positive|,|an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career .|
|positive|,|in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works .|
|positive|,|some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book . hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors .|
|positive|,|sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open .|
|positive|,|behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart .|
|positive|,|everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse .|
|positive|,|manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas .|
|positive|,|singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs  a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story  but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece .|
|positive|,|you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here .|
|positive|,|whether or not you're enlightened by any of derrida's lectures on "" the other "" and "" the self , "" derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow .|
|positive|,|a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors .|
|positive|,|this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever .|
|positive|,|disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both .|
|positive|,|just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing .|
|positive|,|the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense .|
|positive|,|the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la|
|positive|,|morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start .|
|positive|,|part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness .|
|positive|,|son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness .|

|negative|,|Boo! Heading to the airport. "|
|negative|,|simplistic , silly and tedious .|
|negative|,|it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .|
|negative|,|exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .|
|negative|,|[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .|
|negative|,|a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .|
|negative|,|the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .|
|negative|,|about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .|
|negative|,|not so much farcical as sour .|
|negative|,|unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .|
|negative|,|all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .|
|negative|,|a sentimental mess that never rings true .|
|negative|,|while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary .|
|negative|,|interesting , but not compelling .|
|negative|,|on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .|
|negative|,|while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .|
|negative|,|there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid|
|negative|,|nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah .|
|negative|,|such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us "" the skulls "" and last year's "" rollerball . "" enough said , except : film overboard !|
|negative|,|here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha .|
|negative|,|this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .|
|negative|,|the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl .|
|negative|,|on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation .|
|negative|,|it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action .|
|negative|,|a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films .|
|negative|,|as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .|
|negative|,|the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville .|
|negative|,|our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender  and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '|
|negative|,|the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . .|
|negative|,|the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here .|
|negative|,|stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's "" waking up in reno . "" go back to sleep .|
|negative|,|somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .|
|negative|,|the action clichés just pile up .|
|negative|,|payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .|
|negative|,|the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear .|
|negative|,|another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie .|
|negative|,|i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived .|
|negative|,|please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film .|
|negative|,|most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved|
|negative|,|. . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee .|
|negative|,|curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary .|
|negative|,|though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set .|
|negative|,|there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again .|
|negative|,|the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable .|
|negative|,|analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .|
|negative|,|with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins .|
|negative|,|stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .|
|negative|,|to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .|
|negative|,|equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 .|
|negative|,|the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition .|
|negative|,|everything is off .|
|negative|,|when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '|
|negative|,|an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .|
|negative|,|imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .|
|negative|,|pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .|
|negative|,|forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?|
|negative|,|an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .|
|negative|,|though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .|
|negative|,|pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest .|
|negative|,|a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .|
|negative|,|watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost .|
|negative|,|. . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .|
|negative|,|the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .|
|negative|,|the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end .|
|negative|,|the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .|
|negative|,|mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .|

|negative|,|even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .|

|negative|,|in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .|

|negative|,|i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent .|
|negative|,|one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .|
|negative|,|there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .|

|negative|,|though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .|
|negative|,|just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .|
|negative|,|the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch .|

|negative|,|holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .|
|negative|,|the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .|
|negative|,|a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family .|
|negative|,|what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .|
|negative|,|stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .|
|negative|,|bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .|
|negative|,|there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening .|

|negative|,|what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky .|
|negative|,|it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long .|
|negative|,|the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) .|
|negative|,|such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .|

|negative|,|[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .|
|negative|,|every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol .|

|negative|,|ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless .|

|negative|,|although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual .|
|negative|,|gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story .|
|negative|,|a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .|
|negative|,|[p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .|
|negative|,|'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '|
|negative|,|gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .|
|negative|,|parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core .|
|negative|,|the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving .|
|negative|,|bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .|
|negative|,|a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .|

|negative|,|bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie .|
|negative|,|watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .|
|negative|,|the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland .|
|negative|,|the film can depress you about life itself .|
|negative|,|i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché .|
|negative|,|the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line .|
|negative|,|its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .|
|negative|,|the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .|
|negative|,|sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .|
|negative|,|at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .|
|negative|,|here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .|
|negative|,|an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets .|
|negative|,|an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .|
|negative|,|unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .|
|negative|,|it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty .|
|negative|,|glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum .|
|negative|,|this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .|
|negative|,|it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say .|
|negative|,|all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .|
|negative|,|a big fat pain .|
|negative|,|a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 .|
|negative|,|unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .|
|negative|,|watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures .|
|negative|,|aan opportunity wasted .|
|negative|,|an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .|
|negative|,|to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .|
|negative|,|with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .|
|negative|,|mild , meandering teen flick .|
|negative|,|though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .|
|negative|,|though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before .|
|negative|,|although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league .|
|negative|,|astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild .|
|negative|,|one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou .|
|negative|,|with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .|
|negative|,|to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough .|
|negative|,|cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .|
|negative|,|diane lane's sophisticated performance can't rescue adrian lyne's unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .|
|negative|,|not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were  i doubt it would be all that interesting .|
|negative|,|storytelling feels slight .|
|negative|,|[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .|
|negative|,|this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero .|
|negative|,|silly , loud and goofy .|
|negative|,|why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?|
|negative|,|the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .|

|negative|,|the pool drowned me in boredom .|
|negative|,|it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism .|
|negative|,|it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .|
|negative|,|some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .|

|negative|,|as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .|
|negative|,|the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .|
|negative|,|it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , "" look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! "" but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .|
|negative|,|the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid .|
|negative|,|bad company . bad movie . just plain bad .|
|negative|,|it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .|
|negative|,|avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book .|
|negative|,|a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .|
|negative|,|while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .|
|negative|,|woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the "" saving private ryan "" battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ?|
|negative|,|it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .|
|negative|,|. . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts .|
|negative|,|this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter .|
|negative|,|why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one .|
